--scripts that will run on your database to create the tables that hold the values from your models

Whenever you add a model to models.py file and run migrations, Django creates a script that says how to create
database

Need to register the models app. Go to settings.py, INSTALLED_APPS, add model path to app (stevend_website.apps.accounts), then python manage.py makemigrations
You will have migrations to do now, so you need to run python manage.py migrate

go to your /admin page to check above migrations worked
If you delete your database, it will use the migrations py files to recreate it
